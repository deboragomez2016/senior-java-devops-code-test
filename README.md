# myToys Code Test

## Description

Create a microservice using Spring boot that will provide a list of books suggested by the search API provided by [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using) and store them in a in-memory database.

This data should be presented as a REST API that has to include the documentation of the endpoints using Swagger.

The project should contain unit tests and integration tests for the microservice.

The project should also contain a README file with an explanation of the used technologies and the changes that need to be made before going into a production environment.

## Delivery

A bitbucket/github/... repository with the code developed should be sent and a java jar file should also be attached.
